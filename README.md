I used flutter and google firebase filestore to create this flutter app. The objectif of the app is to be able to geolocalise the neraby ATMs and show whish ones are the closest to the user. In case the user chooses one ATM, it opens a new page and shows the itineray from the user's position to the CHOSEN ATM. The entries for each ATM in the database are : name, bank, geopoint(latitude, longitude), isFunctional.

The app has basically 3 mains pages.
